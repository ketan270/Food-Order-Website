        <h1>50 ISRO Partners Involved in its Complete Success</h1>
        <p class="heading-para">In almost 60 years of the Indian Space Program, many industries have been involved in the complete success we have had. Here is a list of our 50 ISRO partners.</p>
        <img src="../images/suppliersImage1.png" alt="ISRO Suppliers" class="main-image">
        <p>The Department of Space of the Government of India has recently been in the news for opening the Indian Space Industry for private players. Their recent webinar, hosted live on YouTube gained a lot of praise and positivity. While the webinar overall provided the DOS and ISRO suggestions to make IN-SPACe better, it was an eye-opener for me. Many of the industries invited to participate were unknown to me. On a further quick search of ISRO's website also didn't provide much insight into the Industry Partners of ISRO. In all these times subreddit r/ISRO comes to the rescue. Based on the inputs, I have compiled this list of ISRO Partners.</p>
        <p>As I searched more, the list of Industry partners kept getting longer. Even many scientists have said that there are over 150 ISRO partners spread all over India. Therefore, it was essential to categorise them for ease of handling and understanding all the data. Through my research based on their company websites and various presentations, I have classified them according to their central subsystem area. You'll also get a summary of future plans of companies involved in the <a href="https://www.aerospacenerd.com/2020/08/20/unlocking-inspace-isro-webinar/" target="_blank">'Unlocking India's Potential in Space Sector'</a> Webinar.</p>
